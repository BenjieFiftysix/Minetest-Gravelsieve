# Gravel Sieve Mod
A Mod for those who do not want to spend half their lives underground...

Inspired from a Minecr**t Video on YT.

This mod simplifies the extraction of ores by the fact that ores can be obtained simply by sieving gravel.

This mod includes two new tools:
 - a hammer to produce gravel from Cobblestone
 - a gravel sieve to find ores

You can sieve the gravel several times but the ore output becomes less each time. The "useless" gravel can
then be crafted to Compressed Gravel (inspired by Modern Hippie) and "cooked" in the furnace to get Cobblestone again.

Recipe for Compressed Gravel:  
  "Gravel sifted *", "Gravel sifted *"  
  "Gravel sifted *", "Gravel sifted *"
